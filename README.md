**BRC-69 Ordinal Inscriptions**

BRC-69 is a new standard for Ordinal Inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain. This Python script provides a method of cryptographically storing an image with embedded metadata on the Bitcoin blockchain as a Bitcoin ordinal.

The overall scheme involves a parent inscription that contains a JSON file. This JSON file indexes all of the child scripts by their Satoshi number and describes all of their metadata.

How it Works
The script performs the following operations:

Decodes a base64 string to an image.
Embeds metadata into the image using steganography.
Saves the resulting image.
Extracts the metadata from the image.
Writes the extracted metadata to a JSON file.
Usage
Replace <Your_Base64_String_Here> with your actual base64 string that encodes an image. In the metadata_dict, replace <value> and <totalsize> with your actual metadata values. The metadata must be in valid JSON format.

Example:

python
    
Copy code
    
metadata_dict = {
    
    "Token Designation": "BRC-69",
    
    "Satoshi Number": "1234567887654321",
    
    "Parent Satoshi Number": "8765432112345678",
    
    "Collection Name": "My Collection",
    
    "Collection Size": "50",
    
    "Collection Number": "1/50",
    
    "Background": "Blue",
    
    "Body": "Warrior",
    
    "Face": "Happy",
    
    "Head": "Centurion Helm",
    
    "Neck": "None",

    "Waist": "Grenade Belt",

    "Back": "Jetpack",

    "Held": "Futuristic Laser Gun"
}
Please ensure you have installed all necessary Python libraries before running the script.

Dependencies
This script depends on the following Python libraries:

base64
json
PIL (Pillow)
io
stegano
Conclusion
The BRC-69 standard provides a robust method for embedding and extracting metadata from images stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. This allows for unique, identifiable, and verifiable inscriptions in the form of ordinals on the blockchain.
